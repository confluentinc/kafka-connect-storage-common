# Purpose of this module

This module serves to replace the Vulnerable Guava 30.1.1-jre contained within the package hadoop-shaded-guava which is included by the package hadoop-common until such time that the repo upgrades their guava version (at which time this package should be removable).

You can check the current state of the protobuf package in question in its repo:
