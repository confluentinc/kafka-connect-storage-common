/**
 * This class is added as a workaround to maven. Attempting to run both verify and install phases
 * with maven fails if there's no source code in the project (the produced jar is empty).
 * {@see http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/maven-users/201608.mbox/%3c20160805151905.500d5c45@copperhead.int.arc7.info%3e}
 * <br>
 * This fact subsequently fails the attempt to re-shade the dependencies without adding new code.
 * The workaround is to introduce this class here, with the intention to remove it during shading
 * by configuring a filter for maven-shade-plugin.
